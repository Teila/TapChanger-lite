# Endstops

I recommend sensorless XY. 

# X endstop on Y axis

Use `HallSensor.stl` - it is a copy of Tap switch/magnet mount adapted for the shuttle.

# X endstop on Gantry

Very prototypy, moves the X endstop to the gantry, removing wiring to Y axis.

Use `X Endstop Lever.stl`.

It's very specific for Chaoticlabs motor mounts and some Y endstop PCB I had laying around.

Ping me if you happen to make a better solution.
